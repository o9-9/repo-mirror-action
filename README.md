# Mirror Repo GitHub Action

A simple GitHub Actions workflow to mirror (sync) your repository to another git host or repo.
Handles commits, branches, tags, etc. Finishes with a clean job summary.

Why? Because backups are important. Decentralization is healthy. And vendor lock-in is bad.

## Quick start

1) Add a deploy key with write access on your target host (e.g. Codeberg).
2) Save the private key in your GitHub repo as a secret: **`MIRROR_SSH`**.
3) Add a workflow, in your repo, at: `.github/workflows/mirror.yml`

```yaml
name: Mirror
on:
  schedule: [{ cron: '30 01 * * 0' }] # Choose a frequency (e.g. mirror every Sunday at 01:30)
  push: { tags: ['v*'] }              # Or publish whenever a new version (tag) is crearted
  workflow_dispatch:                  # And, enable the workflow to also be manually triggered

jobs:
  mirror:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@v1
        with:
          ssh_key: ${{ secrets.MIRROR_SSH }}  # required! Your SSH private key as a secret
          # host: git@codeberg.org            # optional, defaults to Codeberg (git@codeberg.org)
          # user: your-user-or-org            # optional, defaults to your repo owner
          # repo: target-repo-name            # optional, defaults to your repo name
          # force_push: false                 # optional, force push to overwrite remote (default: false)
```

That’s it! The action will:
- set up SSH,
- add `mirror` remote,
- `git push mirror --all --tags`,
- and post a summary with logs.

## Inputs

| name         | required | default             | meaning                                          |

## How it works

Git mirroring copies your entire repository to another location. It's useful for backups, avoiding vendor lock-in, or keeping repos in sync across platforms.

The action runs on a schedule (like weekly) or when triggered (like on new tags). It checks out your repo with full history, authenticates, then safely pushes everything to your target git host. All branches, commits, and tags from your source repo get pushed to the mirror destination. No changes will be made to your source repo.

---

## Why it's needed

- To keep a backup of your repository in case something goes wrong with GitHub
- To give your users an alternative (non-Microsoft) way to access your code
- To reduce vendor lock-in, so you can switch to another hosting service if needed
- To keep your repository in sync across platforms, such as GitHub and self-hosted GitLab

> [!TIP]
> For example, I have mirrored my projects over to Codeberg, at [codeberg.org/alicia](https://codeberg.org/alicia)<br>
> Now, anyone can get these apps, without needing to use Microsoft services 😇

## Step-by-Step Example

First time mirroring a repo? We got you! Below is a step-by-step guide for mirroring a repo from GitHub to Codeberg (but will work the same for any git server).

### 1. Create a Destination Repo
If you've not already got one, head over to Codeberg, create an account and then a new repo.

### 2. Create an SSH key

Use `ssh-keygen` or a tool of your choice, to generate a new SSH key, and then note down the public and private key.

```bash
# Generate new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 64 -C "github-mirror-to-codeberg" -f ./codeberg_mirror_ed25519 -N ""

# Show the public Key (for destination repo, e.g. Codeberg)
cat ./codeberg_mirror_ed25519.pub

# Show the private key (for source repo, e.g. GitHub)
cat ./codeberg_mirror_ed25519
```

</details>

### 3. Add Public Key to new Git Host
Log into Codeberg, and click your account (in the top-right) --> Settings --> SSH / GPG Keys --> Manage SSH --> Add Key.

Pick a good name, and then add your newly generated public key (e.g. from `./codeberg_mirror_ed25519.pub`)

</details>

### 4. Add Private Key to Source Repo

Next, head back to your GitHub repo, and under the repo Settings --> Secrets --> Actions --> New repository secret.

Name it `MIRROR_SSH` (or whatever), then paste your private key (e.g. from `./codeberg_mirror_ed25519`)

</details>

### 5. Create the Workflow

Create a new file, within the `.github/workflows` directory. E.g. `.github/workflows/mirror.yml`.


```yaml
name: Mirror
on:
  schedule: [{ cron: '30 01 * * 0' }]
  push: { tags: ['v*'] }
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  mirror:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@main
        with:
          ssh_key: ${{ secrets.MIRROR_SSH }}
          host: git@codeberg.org
          user: alicia
          repo: pixelflare
```

<details>
<summary>Show me ℹ️</summary>

</details>


### 6. Run the Workflow

Head to your repository's Actions tab. Click your new workflow (on the left), then in the top-right, click `Run workflow`

## More Examples

### Force push to fix out-of-sync mirrors

If your mirror gets out of sync, you can force push to overwrite the remote:

```yaml
- uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@v1
  with:
    ssh_key: ${{ secrets.MIRROR_SSH }}
    force_push: true  # ⚠️ Use with caution - overwrites remote history
```

### Using outputs

Chain the mirror action with other steps:

```yaml
- uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@v1
  id: mirror
  with:
    ssh_key: ${{ secrets.MIRROR_SSH }}
- run: echo "Mirrored to ${{ steps.mirror.outputs.target_url }}"
- name: Notify on success
  if: steps.mirror.outputs.success == 'true'
  run: curl -X POST ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_URL }} -d "Mirror complete"
```

### Mirror to GitLab

```yaml
- uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@v1
  with:
    ssh_key: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_SSH }}
    host: git@gitlab.com
    user: your-gitlab-username
    repo: your-gitlab-project
```

### Mirror to self-hosted Gitea

```yaml
- uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@v1
  with:
    ssh_key: ${{ secrets.GITEA_SSH }}
    host: git@git.example.com
    user: myorg
    repo: myproject
```

### Mirror with user-specified settings

When you run the following workflow, GitHub will popup with a little form, which you can then fill in to specify the target repo settings.

```yaml
name: Mirror to Somewhere

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
        host:
          description: "SSH host (leave empty for Codeberg)"
          required: false
        user:
          description: "Target user/org (leave empty for current repo owner)"
          required: false
        repo:
          description: "Target repo name (leave empty for current repo name)"
          required: false
        force_push:
          description: "Force push to overwrite remote"
          required: false
          type: boolean

jobs:
  test-mirror:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Mirror
        uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@main
        with:
          ssh_key: ${{ secrets.MIRROR_SSH_TEST }}
          host: ${{ inputs.host || 'git@codeberg.org' }}
          user: ${{ inputs.user || github.repository_owner }}
          repo: ${{ inputs.repo || github.repository }}
          force_push: ${{ inputs.force_push || false }}
```

## Versioning

Use a major tag for stability:

```yaml
- uses: lissy93/repo-mirror-action@v1
```

I'll keep `v1` pointing to the latest compatible release.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Permission denied (publickey)</summary>

- Ensure the SSH public key is added to the target host with write access
- Verify the private key matches the public key
- Check the target repository exists

<details>
<summary>Permission denied (publickey)"</summary>

- Ensure the SSH public key is added to the target host with write access
- Verify the private key matches the public key
- Check the target repository exists
</details>


<details>
<summary>Failed to retrieve SSH host keys</summary>

- Network issue or invalid hostname
- Try manually: `ssh-keyscan your-host.com`
- Check firewall/proxy settings
</details>


<details>
<summary>Repository not found</summary>
- Create the destination repository first on the target host
- Verify user/org and repo names are correct

</details>

<details>
<summary>fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories</summary>

- The repos have diverged
- Use `force_push: true` to overwrite (⚠️ caution)
</details>


<details>
<summary>Out of sync" errors</summary>

- Enable `force_push: true` to reset the mirror
- Or manually fix the remote repository
</details>

## Limitations

- Only supports SSH authentication (not HTTPS/tokens)
- Requires target repository to exist beforehand
- Large repositories (>1GB) may take longer to mirror
- Rate limits depend on your target git host
- Cannot mirror GitHub-specific features (Issues, PRs, Actions)
